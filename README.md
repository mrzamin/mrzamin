## Latest update - March 2024

I attended code meetups in March and recently learned through a connection there that an open-source React project is starting up in my area. It's beginner-friendly so I look forward to contributing to that!

## About Me

I’m a career-changer into software development. Most recently I’ve worked in foreign language education services (501c3 nonprofit) as a program director. Now that I’m 26 years old I have decided to look into a fulfilling career change. I feel passionate about programming and am thrilled that I have found that new passion.

JavaScript is my first programming language; before learning it, I had absolutely zero knowledge about programming, software development, or computer science. What immediately struck me as unique was the passionate programming community. The professional people I’ve been priviliged to meet in-person and online all possess a very rare commitment to lifelong learning and curiosity, honing of their craft, and innovation. Anyone you speak to will tell you soberly that this field isn’t easy (on the contrary it’s extremely tough), but what makes it worth it are the personal growth and joy that comes with that commitment.

You can find me writing code and learning new tools daily ever since I’ve set my mind on becoming a hirable developer. In my free time, I enjoy early-morning walks in nature, gardening with my husband, and serving on the film production team at my church. Goals of mine this year include developing a weekly habit of lifting weights for my health and improving my intermediate-level French skills.

## Recent Projects

I’ve learned most of what I know about programming through the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), an open-source project that teaches full-stack web development to newbies using resources that are 100% free across the web. In Odin, you build many, many projects. The curriculum emphasizes mindset, problem solving ability, and importance of the fundamentals. You are expected to develop grit as a developer and overcome obstacles in your code by reading documentation and doing your own research. 

Some recent projects I've worked on:

- To-Do List App (HTML, vanilla CSS and JS) using ES6 modules, webpack, and Web Storage API
- Restaurant Homepage (HTML, vanilla CSS and JS) using ES6 modules and webpack
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game (HTML, vanilla CSS and JS) using JS factory functions
- Library App (HTML, vanilla CSS and JS) using JS object constructors
- Admin Dashboard (HTML, vanilla CSS) using CSS Grid

## Currently Working On

A Weather App to familiarize myself with working with APIs and async code.
